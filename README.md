✔ Mark tasks as complete
✔ Delete tasks

2️⃣ Enhancements & Improvements
✔ Sorting tasks by priority (High → Medium → Low → None)
✔ Editing tasks (Modify description and priority)
✔ Filtering completed vs. pending tasks
✔ Adding due dates and ensuring correct input format
✔ Ensuring all tasks display in a clean table format

3️⃣ UI/Formatting Improvements

🔹 Key Software Engineering Concepts Learned

This project was more than just writing code—it was an introduction to software engineering fundamentals. Here's what we picked up:

1️⃣ Version Control & Git Best Practices
✔ Using git status to check for changes
✔ Using git add . vs. git add filename
✔ Understanding git commit and when to commit
✔ Pushing code to GitHub (git push origin main)

2️⃣ Code Structure & Readability
✔ Keeping functions modular (e.g., load_tasks(), edit_task(), list_tasks())
✔ Using constants for structured data (priority colors)
✔ Ensuring clean, readable output for the user

3️⃣ Debugging & Fixing Issues
✔ Understanding error messages (KeyError, JSONDecodeError)
✔ Ensuring input validation (due_date format handling)
✔ Fixing UI alignment issues by adjusting column spacing

4️⃣ Data Handling & Persistence
✔ Reading & writing JSON files (tasks.json)
✔ Ensuring data remains structured and consistent
✔ Implementing sorting logic on data retrieval
