# 📝 Task Manager

## **📌 Project Overview**
This is a **command-line-based Task Manager** that allows users to efficiently **add, complete, delete, edit, and list tasks** while keeping track of priorities and due dates. It was **built using AI** as part of a structured learning journey to understand core software engineering principles.

---

## **🛠 Features**
✔ Add, complete, delete, and edit tasks  
✔ Sort tasks by priority (High → Medium → Low → None)  
✔ Filter tasks (view pending or completed tasks)  
✔ Assign **due dates** to tasks  
✔ Store data in a **JSON file** for persistence  
✔ Display a **well-formatted task list** with proper column alignment

## **🎯 How This Project Was Built**
This project was developed through an **interactive learning process**, focusing on **progressive software engineering concepts**.  

I started by building a **basic task management system** with simple CLI commands and progressively added features while learning key principles like:
- **Software design & modular functions** (keeping code organized)
- **Version control with Git & GitHub** (incremental commits for each feature)
- **Data handling with JSON** (storing and retrieving structured data)
- **Debugging & problem-solving** (fixing UI misalignments, logic errors)
- **User experience improvements** (better CLI interactions, formatted output)

Each step in this project was structured to **apply real-world development practices**, ensuring that every improvement was made incrementally, with clear version control and feature validation.

## **🛠 Technologies Used**
- **Python 3** (Core scripting)
- **JSON** (Data storage)
- **Git & GitHub** (Version control)
- **VS Code** (Development environment)

## **🚀 Next Steps**
This project laid the foundation for **understanding software engineering principles**. The next step is transitioning to a **REST API project** where similar concepts will be applied to **backend API development**.
