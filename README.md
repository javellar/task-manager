# 📝 Task Manager

## **📌 Project Overview**
This is a **command-line-based Task Manager** that allows users to efficiently **add, complete, delete, edit, and list tasks** while keeping track of priorities and due dates. It was built with the assistance of AI as part of a structured learning journey to **understand core software engineering principles**.

## **🛠 Features**
✔ Add, complete, delete, and edit tasks  
✔ Sort tasks by priority (High → Medium → Low → None)  
✔ Filter tasks (view pending or completed tasks)  
✔ Assign **due dates** to tasks  
✔ Store data in a **JSON file** for persistence  
✔ Display a **well-formatted task list** with proper column alignment

## **🤝 How This Project Was Built**
This project was developed through an **interactive collaboration** between **human problem-solving** and **AI-assisted engineering**.

### **🔹 Collaborative Process**
- **I led the development process**, applying software engineering principles, writing code, and debugging issues.
- **AI-assisted in problem-solving**, helping refine logic, optimize code structure, and debug complex issues efficiently.
- **Version control with Git** was used to ensure an iterative, structured approach to development.
- **Each feature was discussed, planned, and then implemented**, reinforcing real-world software development workflows.

This project was built with a strong emphasis on **learning software engineering concepts** while following best practices in:
- **Software design & modular functions** (keeping code organized)
- **Version control with Git & GitHub** (incremental commits for each feature)
- **Data handling with JSON** (storing and retrieving structured data)
- **Debugging & problem-solving** (fixing UI misalignments, logic errors)
- **User experience improvements** (better CLI interactions, formatted output)

By leveraging AI for **technical guidance and debugging**, I was able to **focus on decision-making, design, and implementation**,
